								<p>“Are you certain?” he asked, “Are you sure?”
									“Sure as I ever have been of anything,” said Mrs. Owens.
									“Then yes. If you ‘ll be his mother, I’ll be his father.”
									
									In this paragraph, Mrs. Owens tried to convince Mr. Owens to keep the child as themselves. She considered this boy as their own responsibility. Even she only meet the child’s mother one time, she totally take this child as her duty. And Mr. Owens did not refuse at first, he just asked again to ensure she is considered enough or not. However, when Mrs. Owens said she is really want to be the child’s mother, he agree to be child’s father. And the reason why Mr. Owens agree is just because that he love Mrs. Owens. He shared all the responsibility with his lover, which is hard to see in nowadays. I really been touched through their talking and wish I can be as responsible as they were.

									“It seemed to travel with her, to sweep her aloft in the power of song, so that she was moving in glory among the stars, and for a moment she, too, felt that the words Darkness and Light had no meaning, and only this melody was real”
									
This quote from A Wrinkle in Time summarizes the novel's central themes of light and darkness, good and evil, and the power of love. This quotation was chosen by me, and it highlights an important aspect of the book. This is in chapter 11, the Aunt Beast. This chapter is basically talking about Meg and the rest of the people who were being hosted by the monster. Meg leaned on one of the beast's hairy chests, making her feel safe and comfortable. And the beast hand her a fur blanket and fed her. Meg was encouraged by the beasts to name them, giving them a sense of identity and individuality. She fell asleep afterwards. I feel genuinely happy for Meg, as she finally found peace and safety in the midst of difficulties. The singing of the aunt beasts is so charming and powerful that it lifts Meg's spirit and transports her to another world, beyond the physical realm of light and darkness. Darkness and light have somehow felt meaningless. I observed that Meg was deeply immersed in the tremendous singing from the aunt beasts, which symbolizes the power of love and hope that can overcome any darkness or evil, I assumed. She didn't even need to be bothered by all of the chaos and fear around her, she could have stayed in that moment forever. However, Meg did not. Instead, she follows her purpose and faces the dangers that lie ahead with the member of her crew.

								<p>“Maybe I don’t like being different, Meg said.
									But…I don’t want to be like everybody else either.”
									
									This story resonates with those who have grappled with the challenges of self-identity and the societal expectations to fit in. It inspires us to appreciate our distinctiveness, embrace our diversity, and find the bravery to deviate from the norm. Meg's transformative journey in "The Wrinkle in Time" serves as a powerful reminder that by embracing our individuality and recognizing our inherent worth, we can unlock our true strengths and create a meaningful and beneficial influence on the world.

								<p>I have found out there are several issues and similarities that accidentally stand between both novels. I found out one of the most important underlying themes in The Graveyard Book is courage and facing fears. As a kid raised in a graveyard, Nobody Owen definitely needs to learn to deal with all of the supernatural beings that he is unfamiliar with. Throughout the novel, he is determined to adapt, learn, embrace, and eventually overcome the fear that the entire environment has given to him. “The Graveyard Book” emphasizes that fear is not inherently negative, but rather how it is approached and responded to that determines its impact. Neil Gaiman suggests that fear can be harnessed as a motivating force for change. The exploration of fear in the novel is the theme of courage. He highlights the importance of courage in overcoming fears and adversities. Nobody Owens's journey through the graveyard is a testament to the transformative power of courage, as he learns to confront his fears, stand up against the forces that threaten him, and embrace his own strength. Compete with other supernatural entities, discovered the unknowing danger, and ultimately stepped out of the graveyard, therefore I believe the courage issue stands a huge part in the underlying theme of the book
									Also, courage and facing fears are also exceedingly important factors that contain in “A Wrinkle in Time”. The main character, Meg, was having a hard time fighting with her insecurities, always doubting herself. The novel, it did showcase how Meg overcome her fear and begin her journey on saving her father. Another point I noticed is Meg is always willing to sacrifice herself to showcase her courage, throughout the entire novel, Meg is always the one who stepped into danger and attempts to protect the ones who she loves the most, this has unquestionably underscored her courage, bravery, and facing her own fear. Meg and her companions journey through different worlds, encountering malevolent forces that seek to dominate and oppress. The author of “A Wrinkle In Time”, L'Engle highlights the importance of courage, perseverance, and the willingness to stand up against darkness. The novel serves as a reminder that even in the face of overwhelming odds, the light of love and truth can prevail. L’ Engle portrays Meg as a brave teenage girl to overcome the darkness and fear. 
									Both two novel portrays courage as a necessary ingredient for growth, resilience, and the pursuit of a fulfilling life. The fear must appear in our life while we are growing up, we need to learn how to face and overcome the fears and courage ourselves.
